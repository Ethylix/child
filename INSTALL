To compile, type :

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

Useful cmake options :
 -DUSE_FILTER=1 : enable data filtering (see doc/filter.conf)

Copy ./doc/example.conf to ./child.conf, and edit it
If you compiled with filter support, you can copy ./doc/filter.conf to ./filter.conf and edit it
Then, you can start child by typing ./child
