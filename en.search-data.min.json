Register a channel Manage access lists Moderating     Register a channel    You now have your account and want to register your channel. To do so, you need to be +o (op) on a channel that is not registered yet.\n/join #newchannel By entering the channel, the server will give you +o. You can check that you are op on the channel by looking at the nicklist. If you have an @ in front of your nickname, you are op on the channel.\nTo register the channel:\n/msg C chan register #newchannel The channel is now yours, you can check its information by using the info command:\n/msg C chan info #newchannel Which will reply:\nC (cserve@geeknode.org): Informations for channel #newchannel: C (cserve@geeknode.org): Founder: YOU C (cserve@geeknode.org): Options: Secure Axxflags C (cserve@geeknode.org): Registration time: Sun Aug 16 18:51:58 2021 Manage access lists    Your channel is now very popular and you need help in moderating it and would like to have your friend Lord be op. There are two ways to manage ACL (access lists) on channels using Child: levels and flags. Using flags is easier though levels are giving the most flexibility as they help in setting up a stronger hierarchy between members. We will use flags for simplicity.\nFor instance, if we wanted to make sure that our friend Lord was auto-oped every time they joined the channel, we\u0026rsquo;d use:\n/msg C chan access flags #newchannel Lord +O That\u0026rsquo;s it, flags are as simple as that. You can find the list of flags and their meaning in this page.\nChild is also able to take orders directly from the channel via a set of commands described here. For instance, if I wanted to op Lord on my channel, I could do:\n!op Lord Which would get Child to op Lord:\nMode #cserv [+o Lord] by C Moderating    A big part of owning a channel is to make sure that it stays peaceful. It is your space and you dictate the rules. From time to time, you might get users that are not abidding by those rules. As an op on the channel, you might need to kick or ban people. You can do so using Child:\n!kick BadUser !ban BadUser There are plenty other commands available for you to use to moderate your channel available on this page.\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/child/usage/manage-account/","title":"Managing your account","parent":"Usage","content":"Child\u0026rsquo;s NickServ is accessible via /msg C nick.\nThe first thing to do if you didn\u0026rsquo;t already is to register your account:\n/msg C nick register PASSWORD EMAIL You will then receive a notice from C:\nC (cserve@geeknode.org): You are now registered.
